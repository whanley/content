                    <head>THE KHEDIVES DECLARATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The interview granted by the Khedive to a French journalist, a translation of
                        which will be found in another column, has attracted a considerable amount
                        of attention, and a section of the home Press is by no means inclined to
                        accept with a good grace His Highness’s neglect to mention the share of
                        Great Britain in the development of this country, which he described in such
                        feeling terms to M René Puaux. There is no reason for those who are in touch
                        with local politics to exhibit any surprise at this omission. If the warmest
                        expressions of gratitude to the Occupation had flowed from the Khedive’s
                        lips, and he had made the most sincere acknowledgment of the obligations
                        Egypt was under to Lord Cromer’s administration, his Highness’s declarations
                        would in all probability have been branded as remarkable examples of
                        Oriental duplicity by the "Times,” while they would have been received with
                        silent indignation by the Moslem Nationalist Press and have evoked
                        disagreeable protests from Constantinople. Moreover, as we pointed out when
                        the telegraphic summary of the interview reached Egypt, His Highness was
                        discussing political matters with a Frenchman, and any laudatory allusions
                        to the part we had played here would have wounded the susceptibilities of a
                        large number of French people, who regard the abandonment of their country’s
                        historical claims in Egypt as a mortifying episode in their foreign
                        politics. Any such allusions would have at once been noticed by the French
                        Press, and such persons as Madame Adam, M. Flourens, and other Anglophobes
                        would have become far more furious at the Khedive for his sins of commission
                        than is the “Times” for his sins of omission. His Highness was between
                        Scylla and Charybdis, and he wisely chose the lesser of the two evils. Had
                        he adopted a tone designed to flatter England’s <cb n="6"/>just pride in her
                        work in Egypt, he would have not propitiated the “Times,” which accused him
                        a few weeks ago of supporting Mustapha Pasha Kamel’s recent journalistic
                        ventures, while his remarks might easily have been resented not only at
                        Yildiz Kiosk and on the Boulevards, but by a large section of his own
                        subjects. We have no doubt that the Viceroy in his heart of hearts is not
                        dissatisfied with a regime which has made him the richest man in Egypt, but
                        at the same time he would not be human if he did not long for the time to
                        come when he would be able to free himself from his political Mentors. After
                        all the Merovingian who is only too pleased to leave the management of his
                        realms to a masterful Mayor of the Palace is the most contemptible type of
                        potentate known to history.</p>
                    <p>The presumption underlying the “Times’s” criticism is the denial of the
                        Khedive’s right to have his own point of view. This is clear from the
                        critioism which the London newspaper passes on the last three words the
                        Khedive employed to the interviewer in his Highness’s message to the French
                        people. The “Times” appears to think that the Khedive ought to have been
                        thoroughly satisfied with the Anglo- French <hi rend="italic">entente</hi>
                        owing to the political results ensuing therefrom to Egypt. Surely this is a
                        most erroneous standpoint to assume. Up to that time the conflicting
                        jealousies of England and France in Egypt placed the Khedive in the happy
                        position of <hi rend="italic">Tertius gaudens</hi>. It was as much to his
                        Highness’s interest to see the two Powers maintaining their secular
                        antagonism as it had been Bismarok’s. It would doubtless be a good thing for
                        Ireland if the old hatred between the Orangemen and the Catholics were a
                        thing of the past and if both agreed to sink their political and religions
                        differences. If such an event had come to pass during the bitterest period
                        of the Gladstonian Home Rule agitation, the “Times” sentiments towards
                        Ulster would be very similar to the Khedive’s towards France as expressed in
                        his interview with M. Puaux. Both points of view are quite justifiable when
                        all the circumstances of the cases are taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>There is little else to remark on in the interview. The Khedive says there is
                        no fanaticism in the country. We agree—that had ceased last September. His
                        Highness shows the sympathy for the national claims which we believe he
                        always has entertained, and he announces that he has no intention to follow
                        the prodigality of Ismail Pasha, which we can well believe. For the rest, we
                        have a homily on the duty of Princes, which might well have been modelled on
                        the injunctions contained in that <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> for
                        princely discourses, the eighteenth chapter of "II Principe.” “A Prince is
                        to have particular care that nothing falls from his mouth but what is full
                        of the five qualities of mildness, mercy, courtesy, religion and sincerity,
                        and that to see and hear him he appears all goodness, integrity, humanity,
                        and religion, which last he ought to pretend to more than ordinarily,
                        because more men do judge by the eye than by the touch. For everybody sees
                        how you appear, but few dare not oppose the opinion of the multitude, who
                        have the majesty of their prince to defend them. And in the actions of all
                        men, especially princes, where no man has power to judge every one looks to
                        the end. Let a prince, therefore, do what he can to preserve his life and
                        continue his supremacy, the means which he uses shall be thought honourable,
                        and be commended by everybody, because the people are always taken with the
                        appearance and event of things, and the greatest part of the world consists
                        of the people.” These counsels are followed in the carefully weighed words
                        his Highness employs in his declaration to the French journalist, and for a
                        strong-willed Prince, who has been placed in the delicate position of ruling
                        an unwarlike people and an important state with the assistance of a <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> sovereign and a <hi rend="italic">de
                            jure</hi> suzerain, there can be no more useful counsellor than the
                        Florentine political philosopher.</p>

                    <head>RENTS AT KHARTOUM.</head>
                    <p>Much concern is felt in Khartoum at the upward tendency in house rents. It is
                        now admitted that this state of things is the natural outcome of the present
                        economic conditions. The rise in the price of building sites as well as the
                        dearness of building materials have justified landlords in raising their
                        rents which, after all, are a poor return on the capital involved. This fact
                        should be always borne in mind when rents are considered. We hear that the
                        Government has estimated the rents of its houses inhabited by the officials
                        as 4% of the cost of building, the land being left out. Even then, we are
                        told, the better class of these houses will bring in as much as £E 100 to £E
                        120. Now a private landlord can do no less, if his money means anything to
                        him. And then the demand for houses has been so great that many people are
                        at a loss how to find a shelter within their means. Yet it is much cheaper
                        to pay a high rent than to build one’s own house.</p>
                    <p>This state of things has led many to believe that the present conditions
                        cannot prevail long. It is believed by these that the prices of land must
                        give way, but this does not seem probable and the relief, if any, must come
                        from another quarter.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that Khartoum is crowded. The increase in the number of
                        population exceeds the corresponding increase in the number of dwelling
                        places. It would be a different matter when bridges make Khartoum and
                        Omdurman one town. As building sites in the latter place are cheap and will
                        remain so for years it will be an easy matter for many residents in Khartoum
                        to live in the old town, coming over daily to Khartoum for their work, at a
                        small cost of money and time.</p>

                    <p>M. Georges Vayssié writes in the “Journal du Caire” :—</p>
                    <p>“The Divine Envoy, Father of the “Standards,” recently rose up and climbed
                        the minaret of the mosque of the Appeal to the peoples of Islam and there
                        muezzoned as follows : “Verily I say unto you. One more day and the ‘Journal
                        du Caire’ will be reduced to ashes and dust.” It is a good thing not to be
                        too impressionable, though the prospect of bring pulverised is always rather
                        unpleasant. In my expectation of this catastrophe I decided —weakly
                        enough—to take refuge in the desert. Sunday passed, Monday followed, and at
                        night-fall I decided to return furtively to Cairo and its journal, or at
                        least the smoking ruins of that organ of imposture. Oh miracle ! No
                        catastrophe! No firemen! Between Sunday and Wednesday the Prince of Egypt
                        and Bar-to-Bar had hurled nothing in my face but words.”</p>
                    <p>After rallying the Pasha on his attempts to explain away the articles
                        produced during his salad days—if not later—he compares the declarations of
                        the “Standards” and of “Al Lewa” and closes with the following interesting
                        letter written on April 22, 1906, to M. Bourgeois, Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs, by M. Jonuart, Governor-General of Algeria :</p>
                    <p>“It was in consequence of a violent campaign carried on against us by that
                        Egyptian (Moh. Bey Ferid) after a journey in French N. Africa and Europe, in
                        which he gave proofs of his hostility and bad faith, that the circulation of
                        ‘Al Lewa’ had to be forbidden on the proposal of my predecessor, by a decree
                        dated April 4, 1902. Since this foreign sheet continued to be frankly and
                        consistently hostile to us and we had to take into account the spirit
                        animating its director, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, as shown in the translations
                        which you were good enough to send me and in reports which I had received, I
                        recently decided that it was necessary for me to renew my instructions to
                        the competent authorities to carry out rigorously the decree interdicting
                        the circulation of ‘Al Lewa’ and to seize every copy of that paper the
                        instant it entered Algeria.”</p>

                    <p>The mail steamer Marmora, with T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught on
                        board, dropped her anchor in the Suez Bay at 12.10 this afternoon. Their
                        Royal Highnesses were welcomed after free pratique was granted by Mr. D. A.
                        Cameron, C.B., H.B.M.’s Consul- General, Major-General Bullock, and his Aide

                        Captain of the Port, and Schalch Bey, Commandant of Suez Police.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards, T.R.H. landed at the Suez Docks station, where they were
                        met by H.E. the Governor of Suez, Mr. A. Williams, Director of Customs, M.
                        De Tunis, Chief of Police, Macauley Bey, Mr. Schmidt, principal agent of the
                        Suez Canal Co, Mr. V. H Laferla, Pro-Consul at Suez, and others, when these
                        officials were introduced to the Duke by Mr. D. A. Cameron and Watson
                        Pasha.</p>
                    <p>The special train, which was waiting in readiness, steamed out of the station
                        shortly after, amidst the cheers of the spectators, and after a short
                        stoppage at the Suez station, left for Cairo at 2.10 p.m.</p>
                    <p>THE ARRIVAL IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>By 6.30 a native crowd had already begun to collect round about Cairo
                        station, a crowd consisting of the usual motley individuals who always have
                        time at their disposal. There were patient grey beards taking up their
                        positions on the steps, fellaheen and blue-robed porters passing hither and
                        thither, young Egyptians in every garb that personal taste dictated, short
                        coats over cotton galabiehs, long silken robes, or the smartest of Norfolk
                        suiting and narrow yellow boots, the crimson tarboosh topping each and every
                        one. Black-robed women, sore-eyed children, cheeky little bootblacks and
                        their brother wallads, and a hundred other units were there to force their
                        way to the front and to be pushed back into line by the energetic police. By
                        6 o’clock many others had arrived to meet the distinguished visitors,
                        carriages and motors were drawn up in line, and the Khedivial equipages with
                        their stalwart upstanding horses were in position. The light was slowly
                        fading from the sky, and the electric arcs were softly gleaning when the
                        escort of Lancers heralded the approach of H.H. the Khedive, and a few
                        minutes later, the cries of the sayces cleared the way for the carriage of
                        Lady Cromer. The crimson carpet on the steps was hastily flicked over for
                        the last time, the whistle of the approaching train was heard, a few belated
                        personages dashed to their places; and a few minutes after the appointed
                        time our royalties were making their adieux on the station steps and taking
                        their places in the carriages. Even in the fading light it was possible to
                        recognize the striking likeness of the Duke to our well-beloved sovereign;
                        and into most English minds there came that feeling of greatest satisfaction
                        that once again we were honoured by the presence of English Royalty among
                        us. An oriental crowd is nearly always silent and no expressions of
                        good-will or welcome were heard as carriage after carriage rolled away from
                        the station, and those containing the honoured visitors and Lady Cromer
                        bearing them swiftly to the Agency, that bearing H.H. the Khedive following
                        a few seconds later surrounded by his escort.</p>

                        thither when telling me about Egypt being the loveliest country in the
                        world, but nothing at that time led me to foresee the pleasant mission which
                        was to be entrusted to me.</p>
                    <p>"I said that you would come.” Such were the kind words, with which the
                        Khedive received me to-day on the threshold of his residence at Koubbeh,
                        where he lives in the winter. The day was a glorious one. The odours of the
                        spring-time rose from the garden. The almond trees are in flower. The birds
                        chirrup joyfully beneath the acacias in the aveuue and the Egyptian sky is
                        cloudless. Would that everyday life here were as calm as the climate, but
                        the excitement in Egypt arouses serious problems. The tactical errors of
                        English policy have given rise to a rather lively expression of discontent.
                        The abdication of the Khedive has even been mentioned, for he is tired of
                        seeing that his authority does not meet with recognition. His reserve and
                        the silence he has persisted in maintaining for many years past have given
                        grounds for all kinds of suppositions. But in my case he has revoked these
                        tactics and I am delighted to be in a position to publish here­with his
                        Highness’s declarations.</p>
                    <p>"The necessities of a peculiar political situation have forced me for a long
                        time past to refrain from the public expression of my opinions on my
                        countrys affairs. However, since you tell me that this silence is a source
                        of conjecture and error outside of Egypt, and since I am aware that even
                        here my reserve is interpreted in various ways, I will seize the
                        opportunity, which is offered me by the visit ofa friend, who is at the same
                        time an envoy in Egypt of “Le Temps” to make known my feelings and my
                        thoughts.”</p>
                    <p>‘I am passionately fond of my country, as every Egyptian, from the highest to
                        the lowest loves his native land. We are attached to our soil. It is ours,
                        our welfare and our devotion to it are inseparable. We cannot die far away
                        from Egypt. Egyptians do not emigrate. When away from their native land they
                        suffer from home sickness and they always come back to Egypt. I recall the
                        look of the poor fellahs whom I have met with in my travels. The deep pain
                        and the keen yearning to see again their hamlets in the Delta or in Upper
                        Egypt were so marked that the sight touched my heart. They have an
                        instinctive love of their own country, which takes the place of philosophy
                        and the science of history. These conservative folk are progressive. I have
                        followed their development day by day and have been struck by the great ease
                        with which they assimilate European culture. Whatever it be you show the
                        Egyptian, the, most complicated machine, the most perfect tools, he will at
                        once learn to use them. I have seen in my own works the most delicate
                        apparatus handled by Egyptians. The engineers, who showed me over, prided
                        themselves in pointing out to me that all their staff were natives. It had
                        been formed in a few weeks. This intelligence has been employed in the
                        development of modern civilisation in Egypt. The people have quickly adapted
                        themselves to their new conditions. They understand and profit by them. The
                        day is at hand when the Egyptian peasant with be on the same footing as the
                        people of the same class in the most progressive countries. The finances
                        have indeed come back to a firm state. We have got the confidence of Europe
                        to such a degree that Cairo and Alexandria are two of the most important
                        financial centres in the world. The international control of the Egyptian
                        debt is henceforth a thing of the past. It is now time to bring all our
                        efforts to bear not only towards the wellbeing of the population but towards
                        the satisfaction of their intellectual and moral wants. As far as I am
                        concerned I have no more serious preoccupation. It is quite wrong that it is
                        alleged that the national claims (revendications nationales) have taken an
                        anti-foreign and fanatic character I absolutely deny this charge. The
                        Egyptian people are naturally good. They are honest, hard-working and
                        tolerant. When they are treated gently and kindly they know how to reply.
                        Toleration is one of the great laws of our religion. The Koran enjoins on us
                        respect for all the prophets, whether they be Christians or Jews. We are all
                        deeply attached to our faith and faithful to its behests. I have travelled a
                        great deal and believe me, if everybody followed the moral precepts of their
                        religions as scrupulously as do the Moslems there would be less evil in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“It has also been stated that I aspired to the re-establishment of my
                        personal power in order to wield it in the Eastern way and to take up with
                        the despotic and wasteful habits of my forerunners. To this charge I answer
                        that all my education was in Europe and it is there that I have learnt the
                        necessity of the co-operation of nation and ruler for the administration and
                        welfare of the country. Despotic power would be too heavy a task for my
                        shoulders. Furthermore if all my thoughts had only been directed towards my
                        personal satisfaction, the fifteen years of my reign would have simply been
                        one long unendurable agony. But I am conscious of having worked with all my
                        energy for the good of the country. It is that which has helped to keep up
                            my<cb n="6"/> courage in some difficult times. I have also kept myself
                        out of the question and have one and only one line of policy which is to
                        work in harmony with everybody for the welfare of the land. I have never
                        opposed measures I thought of utility to Egypt, I have never disdained
                        advice.”</p>
                    <p>The Khedive afterwards spoke to me about his work at Mariout, to which he has
                        devoted much time and trouble. He wants by advancing further and further the
                        railway towards the west and in developing Egyptian interests in the
                        direction of Tripoli to lend himself to a very important scheme, a line
                        across Africa to unite Tangiers and Cairo. I was aware of the Khedive’s
                        interest in this work. His Highness’s explanations proved to me that he is
                        always keenly interested in it. The results up to now are moreover
                        noteworthy and it will not be one of the least benefits of his reign. He is
                        very proud of it for it is all entirely due to his initiative.</p>
                    <p>When the Khedive was bringing my audience to an end, he hesitated
                        momentarily, and then concluded with a mournful little smile, “Tell the
                        French to come in numbers to Egypt. We do not forget what they have been for
                        us and we love them well <hi rend="italic">all the same</hi>."</p>

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN JUDGE. PRAISED BY TOLSTOI.</head>
                    <p>The many friends of the late Judge Crosby, formerly of the Mixed Courts at
                        Alexandria, will be interested to hear of a meeting, held on the 7th inst.
                        by many members of the Social Reform Club, of New York, in honor of his
                        memory.</p>
                    <p>Not only had men prominent in the world of art and science gathered there to
                        speak of the qualities of the man who once had resigned as judge of the
                        International Court, Alexandria, to follow Tolstoi, but others sent letters.
                        Among the letters read was one from Count Tolstoi, who said :</p>
                    <p>“ The death of Ernest Crosby is a very great sorrow for me. I realized the
                        strength of my inner spiritual connection with him only when I got the news
                        of his death.</p>
                    <p>“ It is a great and very rare happiness to possess such a friend, of whom one
                        can be sure that he understands you fully, and whose leading innermost force
                        of life is quite the same as your own. And excepting his greater
                        intelligence, talent and high morality, such a man was Ernest Crosby for
                        me."</p>
                    <p>Among the speakers was Edwin Markham, author of “ The Man with the Hoe, ” who
                        read an original poem entitled “ Crosby Called Back ” The last verse ran
                        :</p>
                    <p>Yea, now that your errand is ended,</p>
                    <p>And now that your steps go afar,</p>
                    <p>What strong soul will catch up the splendid, </p>
                    <p>High dream that your spirit attended—</p>
                    <p>The purpose of God for our star ?</p>
                    <p>Letters were read from William Dean Howells, W. J. Bryan, Tom L. Johnson,
                        William Lloyd Garrison and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Among the speakers

                        WORKS.</head>
                    <p>The sixth ordinary general meeting of the shareholders in the Egypt and Sudan
                        Mining Syndicate, Limited, was held on the 19th inst at No. 6, Queen Street
                        Place, Lord Vaux of Harrowden (chairman of the company) presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary Mr. W. F. Garland) having read the notice convening the meeting
                        and the auditors’ report,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : The year which we are reviewing was one of steady
                        progress rather than of brilliant achievement; nevertheless, in looking at
                        the syndicate’s varied interests, there is ground for satisfaction at the
                        record of work done, and at some of the mines the outlook is undoubtedly
                        much brighter than at the commencement of the financial year. Upon our Egypt
                        concession you will have gathered that operations are now being restricted
                        to the Barrahme mine, that being the most promising of the group which we
                        formerly held there under a prospecting licence. In order that we might be
                        in a position to take full advantage of our developments at Barrahme, we
                        thought it well to apply for a mining lease over an area which should
                        embrace the most important of the old workings, which are numerous, existing
                        at that centre. Under a prospecting licence no gold can be removed from the
                        property without the special permission of the Government, whereas under the
                        terms of a mining lease the syndicate is free to develop the property on an
                        extensive scale and to reap the benefit of all gold won in connection with
                        the operations. The lease covers an area of 50 acres, on which the rental is
                        £2 per acre, or £100 per annum. In addition there is a royalty payable to
                        the Government, in terms of the lease, of one-tenth of the annual
                        distributable profits arising under, or in connection with the property so
                        held. At the last general meeting I referred to a discovery met with at the
                        bottom of the old workings at the No. 1 shaft, where we obtained high assay
                        results. In sinking upon this ore-chute below the 130 ft. level we
                        encountered water in greater quantity than we could efficiently deal with
                        with the appliances we then had available. Sinking was consequently
                        temporarily suspended, and since that time operations have been actively
                        carried on in other sections of the mine, with results which are on the
                        whole very encouraging. In July last an agreement was entered into between
                        this syndicate and the Suakin Mining Syndicate, Limited, which was of the
                        nature of a partnership agreement, the Suakin Syndicate to spend upon the
                        Barrahme mine—should they in the course of their operations be satisfied
                        with the prospects—a sum of £10,000, in return for which they became
                        entitled to receive and retain 30 per cent, of all the proceeds derived from
                        the development of the mine or from the sale of the property. The Suakin
                        Syndicate became responsible for the cost of development as from August 1st
                        last, and, consequently, since that date the Egypt and Sudan Syndicate has
                        been relieved of all expenditure in connection therewith. The Suakin
                        Syndicate reserves the power to determine the agreement to any time by
                        giving to this syndicate three months’ previous notice in writing, always
                        provided, however, that they shall have expended on the property a sum of
                        not less than £5,000. Since the close of the financial year a five-stamp
                        battery has been dispatched to Barrahme, with a gas-engine to operate it, as
                        also a winding engine and other machinery. When once the winding-engine is
                        at work it will be possible to cope with the water difficulty, and the
                        continuation of the shaft upon the rich ore-chute below the No. 1 level will
                        be practicable ; and as soon as the five-stamp battery is erected it can be
                        kept regularly running upon the reserves of ore already opened up.
                        Naturally, with a small mill such as this, the returns of gold cannot be
                        large, but by treating the better class ore it is anticipated that the
                        returns will be such as to give the syndicate concerned very material
                        financial assistance. So far as we can see, there is a great probability of
                        the Barrahme mine proving a successful undertaking. The machinery is now
                        being erected, and we hope that within about two mouths we shall be advised
                        that the mill is running. Upon our Berber concession it became necessary to
                        discontinue work at the Negem mine at the beginning of the last summer
                        season in consequence of a temporary stoppage of labour and of water, due in
                        great measure to the exceptional heat. We then shifted our camp to the
                        Shereik mine, about five miles from the River Nile, where labour and water
                        could be more readily procured, and where we had reason to think from the
                        nature of the old workings we might be successful in opening up some
                        valuable shoots of ore. The operations, however, have not been as
                        satisfactory as we anticipated, and Mr. Llewellyn, who has recently visited
                        that centre, has recommended the board that we should discontinue work there
                        and resume operations at the Negam mine. As, however, the hot season is now
                        setting in, we have decided that it would be preferable to delay the
                        resumption of work at Negem until the early autumn. The fact that our
                        developments at Negem have been so promising has always encouraged us to
                        hope that we may eventually be able to deal with that property as a separate
                        undertaking, and we trust that the next season's operationa will enable us
                        to carry our ideas into effect. We need scarcely say that we are watching
                        with very particular interest the developments at the Om Nabardi mine, owned
                        by the Sudan Gold Field, Limited, in which we have so great a stake. We have
                        given you in our report some extracts taken from the annual report of that
                        company issued in November last,<cb n="2"/> which are of a decidedly
                        encouraging nature. The Om Nabardi is becoming a mine of considerable
                        extent, and it has the great advantage of a long stretch of reef. Indeed, at
                        the 120-ft level some 2,000 ft of reef formation has been driven through,
                        1,500 ft of which is asserted to be payable. That is, of course, a valuable
                        stretch of ground. This reef is now being actively developed at the 240 ft
                        level, where the superintendent stated it is likely to open up as well as at
                        the 120-ft level, and that there was every probability that it would
                        continue in depth. Mr. Llewellyn’s latest letter, dated from Om Nabardi on
                        the 2nd inst., is very encouraging in this respect, and on the question as
                        to whether the reef generally is looking as well at the second level as at
                        the first, he says he can reply without hesitation that, in his opinion, it
                        is looking better, and that it is in those sections where most work has been
                        done that the improvement is most promising, and he goes on to point out
                        that in an instance where the reef in the first level gave payable ore over
                        a width of 11 ins in the corresponding length of the second level the width
                        is 13 ½ ins, and similarly in another section where the first level gave a
                        reef averaging 10 ins wide, the second level gives an average of 13 ½ ins,
                        and payable reef here means reef averaging well over 1 oz per ton. And,
                        again, referring to the Tennant section of the mine, he says “In all these
                        winzes”—i e., below the first level —“where work has been continued deeper,
                        sinking has revealed a tendency to open out ” Without any undue optimism, I
                        think, therefore, it is safe to say that there is reasonable ground for
                        expecting that, good as the results were in the first level, we may
                        confidently look forward to improvement as we get deeper down the mine.
                        Since our report was issued a fortnight ago, a cablegram has been received
                        by the Sudan Gold Field, Limited, reporting that the reef has now been
                        encountered at the 360-ft level, where, at the point of intersection, it was
                        6 ins wide, and of a value of 1 oz 5 dwts of gold per ton. It is true that
                        the reef is narrow at the point of intersection, but it may reasonably be
                        expected to open out as it is driven upon east and west. The important fact
                        in relation to this advice is that the reef is continuing in depth and of
                        good quality. With the active development policy being pursued by the
                        directors of that company the time should not be far distant when they feel
                        justified in ordering a mill for the treatment of the reserves of ore which
                        are now accumulating. The Om Nabardi mine is the most advanced of any in the
                        matter of development to be found in the Sudan, and we see no reasons why it
                        should not become a very productive and profitable property, in which event
                        our interest of over 70,000 shares would be one of great value. We are also
                        pleased with the satisfactory news being received by the Dareheib and
                        African Syndicate respecting the Onib section of the concession which that
                        syndicate is prospecting. Unquestionably they have made a valuable
                        discovery, and the superintendent appears to be sanguine that it will
                        continue. Those who are best acquainted with mining prospects in Egypt have
                        always held that the Dereheib district was one of the most promising, and it
                        is a source of satisfaction to your board to think that their confidence in
                        this direction appears so far to have been justified. As we hold nearly
                        one-third of the capital of that syndicate it will thus be seen that we have
                        there also an investment of excellent promise. I have not touched upon the
                        balance-sheet, as it is so self-explanatory. I may, however, state that the
                        expenditure for the year to September 30th on the properties being devoloped
                        by us amounted to £9,839 9s 8d, and that the balance of the profit and loss
                        account brought into the current year’s statement is £ 18,483 18s 1d. In
                        view of the fact that we are now expending no money on the Barrahme mine,
                        and that we have decided not to resume operations on the Berber concession
                        until the autumn, the outlay for the present will be much reduced. From what
                        I have said, I think you will gather that we may look forward to the future
                        of this syndicate with a great deal of hope and satisfaction, and I trust
                        that when we next have the pleasure of meeting you we shall be able to show
                        you that our anticipations regarding some of the enterprises in which we are
                        interested have been fully realised. I will conclude by moving “ That the
                        report and accounts now submitted be approved and adopted ”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Frederick Cuthbert seconded the resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Taylor having given particulars of the mining work, the resolution
                        was put to the meeting and carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edgar Taylor was re-elected a director, and the proceedings terminated
                        with a vote of thanks to the chairman.</p>

                        <p>Two matches of the Open Cup were played at Ghezireh on Thursday. The
                            first match between the Staff and Departmental and the Egyptian Army,
                            Past and Present, was most i exciting. It was quite one of the best
                            matches we have witnessed this season The wind played an important part
                            in the game, and had the E. A. the luck to win the toss they would very
                            likely have won. As it was, they only lost by one goal, which was scored
                            during the last 10 seconds of the final chukker.</p>
                        <p>For the Staff, they all did their share, but we have seen Capt Dunbar
                            play better, and Capt. Bartlett’s shots at goal were not quite up to the
                            mark Mr. Hadow, who was a decidedly indifferent player at the beginning
                            of the season, has now come on wonderfully. Mr Jenkinson played a sound
                            game. For the E. A Capt. Rome was always working hard. Col Perrse at No
                            2 did excellent work for his side. Major Pirie was not playing quite as
                            well as usual.</p>
                        <p>In the first chukker the Staff scored two goals. The game was very fast
                            and keen.</p>
                        <p>In the second chukker the E. A. notched their first poiut. Some excellent
                            runs were made by Capt. Bartlett, who, however, failed with his shots at
                            goal </p>
                        <p>In the third chukker, the Staff and Departmental scored another goal, Mr.
                            Hadow being responsible. The E.A. then got going and scored 2 goals,
                            thus bringing the score to 3 all. </p>
                        <p>In the fourth chukker, Capt. Bartlett missed what looked like an easy
                            shot at goal. For the rest of the period play was very level, but the
                            Staff had the wind and just as the bell rang they scored the winning
                            goal. The following were the teams :—</p>

                        <p>Inniskilling Dragoons versus Civilians. </p>
                        <p>This game was rather tame after the first excellent contest. The
                            Civilians were not a representative team, and were rather outclassed by
                            their opponents. The Dragoons scored 2 goals the first chukker, and
                            continued to increase their score, the Civilians only obtaining one
                            point. Final score: Inniskilling Dragoons, 5 ; Civilians, 1.</p>

                    <head>ACHING ALL OVER</head>
                    <p>After Influenza-Rheumatism and Disorders of the Blood. Almost Frantic with
                        Pain.</p>
                    <p>Marvellous Change Effected. Well and Strong; Cured by</p>
                    <p>DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS. </p>
                    <p>“I ached from head to foot, and my face grew pale and thin. To my sorrow I
                        had to give up all work, and for six months remained under medical
                        treatment.” This was once the deplorable state of Mr. Page Buttress, on the
                        staff of the Midland Railway, and residing at 28, Weldon-Street, Leeds.
                        About twelve months ago Mr. Buttress caught a severe cold which developed
                        into acute Influenza, his blood being in a poor condition at the time. The
                        evil after­effects became so serious that Mr. Buttress remained a feeble
                        wreck of himself until in Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People he found
                        new, rich blood that restored to him all his former strength and
                        activity.</p>
                    <p>THESE WERE HIS SYMPTOMS. </p>
                    <p>“Abscesses formed all over my legs and arms,” he said,“and ultimately my
                        whole body became a mass of sores. The agonising pain spread to my head and
                        neck, and at night it was almost impossible to get any rest; in fact, I
                        ached from head to foot. The best medical advice was obtained when I learned
                        that I was suffering from blood-poisoning.</p>
                    <p>“Day by day disease gained a hold on me, and I grew weaker and weaker. Then
                        rheumatism set in. I could not bear the bedclothes on my body, and when
                        anyone came near me I was startled and agitated. The agony of rubbing in
                        outward applications almost drove me mad. So inflamed did my legs become
                            that<cb n="4"/> the only relief I could get was by propping them up
                        higher than my body. My blood seemed turned to water; I lost the use of my
                        hands and feet, and became a helpless wreck. All sorts of nourishment was
                        tried, but food of any kind was nauseating. I could not sleep or rest
                        because of the sores. All my strength vanished, and little I expected to
                        ever work again. My wife, too, was breaking down under the strain of nursing
                        me. </p>
                    <p>‘Sometimes in despair I struggled to get out of bed, but as soon as my feet
                        touched the floor I fell back as helpless as a babe. All sorts of remedies
                        were taken in vain. The pangs of rheumatism nearly sent me out of my mind,
                        and languidness and incessant vomitting pulled me down to nothing. For over
                        six months I remained in this state without hope, when a kind friend brought
                        me a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. And what a difference
                        they made in my life. Not at once, of course, for my state was too serious
                        for immediate change. But steadily and surely as I took these pills, so the
                        inflammation decreased, and I felt brighter. I continued the pills, and next
                        the rheumatic pains passed away. Then I grew stronger and I could take
                        walking exercise without fatigue. I soon found my appetite, and picked up
                        strength so rapidly that in a remarkably short time I returned to work, as
                        strong as ever. Since then I have never looked back, but am well and strong,
                        with new blood coursing through my veins. All traces of my sores and
                        rheumatism have passed away.”</p>
